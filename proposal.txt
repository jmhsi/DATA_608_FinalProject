Links to data source:
original data https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
processed with script in https://github.com/holoviz/datashader/tree/master/examples

I am considering re-running the script on new data from the original site
since I see they have data for 2019. I may also try and combine
yellow taxi and green taxi data.

I would like to do more analysis on this dataset with datashader, and then
try and get interactivity witht he holoviews + bokeh approach.

Specifically, I think the there could be interesting relationships to investigate
between fare, payment type, tip amount, and distance traveled. I also
think using the vendorid category could be interesting and might show
something about where certain vendors (taxi businesses?) operate.

I'm also considering looking at maybe a few years
of data, and giving the option to filter by year. Maybe we can see how fares
or number of rides are changing (maybe due to things like competition from
rideshare).
